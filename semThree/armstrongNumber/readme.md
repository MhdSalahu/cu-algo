Problem: write a program to find the number is armstrong
Details: An Armstrong number is a n digit number, which is equal to the sum of the nth powers of its digits. 
         All the 1 digit numbers (1-9) are Armstrong number because 1*1=1 which is equals to number (1) itself, 2*1=2 which is equals to number(2) itself so on for all          the 1 digit numbers (1-9). 
         There are no 2 digit Armstrong numbers.
